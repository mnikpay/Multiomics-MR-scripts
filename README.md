# Multiomics-MR-scripts
Scripts to do multiomics data analysis based on MR approach:
- co-localization script
- 2-sample MR  script

Convert your GWAS summary data to GSMR and SMR formats prior to the analysis

GSMR manual: http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#Mendelianrandomisation

SMR manual: https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/#DataManagement

Then use the co-localization, and 2-sample MR scripts to find biomarkers that are causally associated with a phenotyope within genomic regions known to be associated with the phenotype.
